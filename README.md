> **Intelligent AI-powered solution that automatically detects and groups related campaigns AFTER they're created, working with your team's natural workflow rather than against it.**


### **The Challenge:**
Multi-department communication (CallHub, Pardot, Facebook) needs to be tracked in Salesforce, but faces these problems:

- **Different Teams, Different Timing:** Various departments create campaigns at different times without coordination
- **No Shared Naming Standards:** "It's a lot of different people in different departments creating these campaigns... not necessarily talking to each other"
- **Separate Recipient Lists Required:** Different opt-out rules mean you can't use one campaign for all channels
- **Need Retroactive Linking:** "The ability to tag or link a campaign to a parent campaign after the fact would make this more workable"
- **Cross-Platform Metrics:** Need unified reporting across CallHub calls, P2P texts, Pardot emails, and social media

### **Why Manual Solutions Don't Work:**
- ❌ **Naming Conventions Fail:** "If we had the organizational structure and discipline to use consistent naming conventions we could do it that way, but..."
- ❌ **Contact-Level Tags Wrong:** "Is there a way to do it that doesn't permanently associate the tag with the contact?"
- ❌ **Can't Use Single Campaign:** "We can't use the same SF campaign for all 3 because the criteria for inclusion will be different"

### **Our Solution:**
- ✅ **Works With Your Chaos:** No behavior change required from teams
- ✅ **Retroactive Grouping:** Links campaigns after they're created
- ✅ **Preserves Separate Lists:** Maintains different opt-out rules per channel
- ✅ **Campaign-Level Association:** Links campaigns themselves, not contacts
- ✅ **Unified Metrics Dashboard:** Pull metrics for all related campaigns together

## 🚀 **Core Features**

### 🧠 **AI Pattern Detection**
- Automatically detects related campaigns using advanced regex and NLP
- Identifies patterns like "June Rally", "Voter Registration", "GOTV" across all platforms
- Ignores channel indicators (CallHub, Pardot, Email, SMS, Facebook, P2P)
- Works retroactively on existing campaigns - perfect for SEIU's use case

### 📊 **Intelligent Confidence Scoring**
- 4-factor algorithm: Name similarity, Temporal proximity, Channel diversity, Creator patterns
- Scores suggestions 0-100% confidence
- Only surfaces high-quality matches (70%+ confidence)
- Auto-approves 95%+ confidence matches after 24 hours

### 🖥️ **One-Click Approval Interface**
- Beautiful Lightning Web Component dashboard
- Users can Approve, Edit, or Reject suggestions with one click
- Real-time confidence indicators and channel visualization
- Responsive design works on desktop and mobile

### 🤖 **Machine Learning Engine**
- Learns from every user decision (approve/reject/modify)
- Improves pattern detection accuracy over time
- Stores successful patterns in ML_Pattern__c object
- Adapts to organization-specific naming conventions

### ⚙️ **Automated Workflows**
- Hourly analysis of campaigns created in last 7 days
- Daily cleanup of old rejected suggestions
- Email notifications for high-confidence matches
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting

### 🏗️ **Parent-Child Campaign Hierarchy**
- **Solves Organization's Exact Need:** Uses Salesforce parent-child relationships as suggested
- **Maintains Separate Campaigns:** Each channel keeps its own recipient list and opt-out rules
- **Campaign-Level Linking:** Associates campaigns themselves, not contacts (as requested)
- **Unified Reporting:** Pull metrics for all linked campaigns together in dashboards
- **Example Result:**
  ```
  📁 June Rally Initiative (Parent)
    ├── 📞 CallHub Calls June Rally
    ├── 📱 CallHub P2P texts June Rally  
    ├── 📧 Pardot Emails June Rally
    └── 📘 Facebook Ads June rally
  ```

## 🏛️ **Real Organization Use Case - Before & After**

### **Before Smart Campaign Grouping:**
The organization creates campaigns like:
- `CallHub Calls June Rally` *(created by organizing team)*
- `Pardot Emails June Rally` *(created by communications team)*  
- `CallHub P2P texts June Rally` *(created by field team)*
- `Facebook Ads June rally` *(created by digital team)*

**Result:** Four separate campaigns with no connection, making unified metrics impossible.

### **After Smart Campaign Grouping:**
1. ✅ **AI Detection:** System automatically detects "June Rally" pattern across all four campaigns
2. ✅ **One-Click Approval:** Campaign manager clicks "Approve" on the 92% confidence suggestion
3. ✅ **Parent Created:** System creates "June Rally Initiative" parent campaign
4. ✅ **Automatic Linking:** All four campaigns become children of the parent
5. ✅ **Unified Metrics:** Dashboard now shows combined metrics for all June Rally activities

**Time Investment:** 5 seconds instead of 30+ minutes of manual coordination.

private static final Integer SAME_WEEK_POINTS = 20;

// Pattern Rules  
private static final Integer EVENT_MATCH_POINTS = 40;
private static final Integer MONTH_MATCH_POINTS = 40;

// Confidence Thresholds
private static final Integer AUTO_SUGGEST_THRESHOLD = 70;
private static final Integer AUTO_APPROVE_THRESHOLD = 95;
```

### **Automation Frequency**

Adjust scheduling in `CampaignGroupingMonitor.cls`:

```apex
// Daily at 9 AM
String dailyCron = '0 0 9 * * ?';

// Every hour
String hourlyCron = '0 0 * * * ?';

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

**Q: No suggestions are generated**
- A: Ensure you have campaigns with similar naming patterns created within the last 7 days

**Q: Pattern detection seems inaccurate**  
- A: The system learns from user feedback. Approve/reject suggestions to train the AI

**Q: Automation not running**
- A: Check scheduled jobs in Setup → Apex Jobs → Scheduled Jobs

**Q: Component not visible**
- A: Ensure Lightning Experience is enabled and component is added to app pages

### **Debug Mode:**

Enable detailed logging by setting debug level to FINEST:
```apex
System.debug(LoggingLevel.FINEST, 'Debug message here');
```
